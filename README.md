# gpaw-installation-files
This folder contains two files for the installation of GPAW on Balena.
icc.py is a wrapper for the compiler
and customize.py contains paths for various libraries. Note that you need to modify the paths to libxc so they point to your own installation directory.
The folder also contains submission files for Balena and Archer
